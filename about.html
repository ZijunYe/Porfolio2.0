          Hey there, it’s Zijun. I am a second-year computer science student at the University of Ottawa. I am enrolled in the coop program and currently seeking a summer 2022 internship. <br><br><br>
          I was born & raised in Zhejiang, China. I moved to Ottawa, Canada while I was in high school.
          In the past few years living in Ottawa, the biggest lesson I learned is to be <span class="highlight-word">open-minded and believe in my ability that I can do anything.</span>
          This idea I originally got from my grade11 computer science class.
          However, I first studied computers in an information and technology course in elementary school. I don’t know the reason, after that class, it didn’t arouse my interest in computers. On the contrary, I feel computers are complex and sophisticated.
          Till I first coded in my grade 11 computer science class, my mind changed.
          The working code really gives me a sense of achievement and I do enjoy the process of coding especially the aha moment.
          That’s the reason I chose to study computer science.
        </p>

          I first discovered the word <span class="highlight-word">“UX & UI”</span> in my freshman year of university.
          I had a class that require us to develop a landing page for enterprise ideas in a team of 5 people.
          I am mainly doing interface design. The professor doesn’t touch any lesson about wireframe and prototyping.
           What he mentions is to mimic the web page by hand drawing, draw anything you want, something that appears on the web page.
           I first used Microsoft OneNote, at that point I didn’t hear about any other tools such as Figma and sketch.
           After the class, it has aroused my interest in web development. I started doing more research about interface design and I started self-taught web-development language and more interface design tools.
           Till now, I am still learning how to become a better UX designer with my enthusiasm.
           As new to the IT industry, I am continuing to explore my interests and experience more technologies.

          <!--<span class="highlight-word">“Work in progress”</span> is my motto.
          I first got this idea from exercise.
          I was really into running;
          In constant practice, I gradually ran from 1km, 2km to 6km...
          The progress makes me more motivated, and I also apply the mindset to other aspects of my life.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Outside of work, I am a <span class="highlight-word">runner</span> and also love doing all kinds of exercise: yoga, pilates,
          kickboxing, biking. I am a <span class="highlight-word">baker</span>, feel free to check out my <a class="check-link" href="https://quasar-driver-172.notion.site/8877e9e91e6f4698a3fedd7e594d93cd?v=60ab76aaa39d44dc9e27c9484d6e90e2">recipe</a>;
          I truly believe to make delicious food, the most important thing is to have a genuine heart when you cook.
          I am also a <span class="highlight-word" >reader</span>, check out what I have read on my <a class="check-link" href="https://quasar-driver-172.notion.site/bookshelf-7684f199062b4b5a95304edea6c9b466">bookshelf</a>.
